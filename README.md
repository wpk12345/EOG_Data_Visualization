## Create React App Visualization

This assessment was bespoke handcrafted for BillKing.

NOTE TO HIRING MANAGER

Thank you for the opportunity. This was a little over my head but I am exited to learn more about GraphQl as all of my experience has been RESTful. I also enjoyed learning about charting data.  I learned so much taking on this task.  I look forward to completing this for my own personal education however after 15 hours or so I was unable to complete it and I feel this may not meet your hiring criterea. If you would like a debrief, feel free to reach out however I must move forward with other studys for interviews for now.  I am in need of a job and I cannot put much more time in this until I am employed.  

Thank you again
